-- Description --
Deadfish is a very odd interpretered programming language created by Jonathan Todd Skinner. Deadfish has a way to output things but it has no way to input them! It has only a few commands, only four in total. It is also case-sensitive, and can deal only with integer values when adding or subtracting, however once squared this number increases greatly.

-- Commands --
i = Increment value in cell
d = Decremen value in cell
s = Square value in cell
o = Output value in cell as character

-- Notes --
When a value is equal to 256 and is incremented, it wraps to 0. When the value is 0 and is decremented, it wraps to 256.

-- How to use the interpreter --
1. The first thing you have to do is compile the C# project
2. After compiling the C# project, create a raw text file with the code you want to execute
3. Then open the interpreter's executable giving it the file as an argument, in Windows this can be done by dragging the file over the interpreter and dropping it running the interpreter with the file as an argument.
