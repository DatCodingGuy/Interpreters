-- Description --
Brainfuck is the most famous esoteric programming language and has inspired the creation of a host of other languages. Due to the fact that the last half of its name is often considered one of the most offensive words in the English language, it is sometimes referred to as brainf***, brainf*ck or BF. This can make it a bit difficult to search for information regarding brainfuck on the web as the proper name might not be used at all in some articles.
