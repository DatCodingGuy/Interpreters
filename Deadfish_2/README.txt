-- How to use the interpreter --
1. The first thing you have to do is compile the C# project
2. After compiling the C# project, create a raw text file with the code you want to execute
3. Then open the interpreter's executable giving it the file as an argument, in Windows this can be done by dragging the file over the interpreter and dropping it running the interpreter with the file as an argument.
